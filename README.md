# KNOT – University Resource & Maintenance Management Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

KNOT is a centralized web-based platform designed to manage university resource booking and maintenance reporting within the Faculty of Engineering. The system integrates lecture hall and laboratory scheduling with campus issue reporting to improve transparency, efficiency, and coordination across students, staff, and technicians.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The Faculty currently relies on manual record books and informal communication methods (verbal reports, emails) to manage lecture hall bookings and maintenance issues. This leads to:

- Booking conflicts and scheduling errors  
- Lack of visibility into request status  
- Delayed maintenance responses  
- Poor coordination between departments  

KNOT addresses these challenges through a unified digital solution.

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

KNOT provides a centralized platform that enables:

- Resource booking and approval workflows  
- Conflict detection and scheduling validation  
- Maintenance issue reporting with urgency tracking  
- Technician assignment and progress updates  
- Integration between booking and maintenance modules  

The system ensures that resources under maintenance cannot be booked, improving operational reliability.
